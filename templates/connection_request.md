## By Manufacturing Process

### CNC Machining
```
Hi {{first_name}}, noticed {{company}} does precision CNC work. We help 
machining shops catch defects from CAD before cutting metal. Would love 
to connect and share what we're seeing in the industry.
```

### Injection Molding
```
Hi {{first_name}}, I see {{company}} does injection molding. We help 
molders build inspection from CAD before cutting the first mold — 
catching defects earlier. Happy to connect.
```

### Die Casting / Cast Metal
```
Hi {{first_name}}, noticed {{company}} does casting work. We help 
foundries and casters reduce scrap with CAD-based defect detection 
that adapts to part changes. Would love to connect.
```

### Stamping / Sheet Metal
```
Hi {{first_name}}, I see {{company}} does metal stamping. We help 
stampers catch defects earlier with inspection models built from CAD. 
Would love to connect and share insights.
```

### Additive Manufacturing / 3D Printing
```
Hi {{first_name}}, noticed {{company}} does additive manufacturing.

## By Pain Point

### Vision Systems Breaking
```
Hi {{first_name}}, heard this a lot from {{process}} manufacturers: 
"Our vision system breaks every time the part changes." We solved 
that with CAD-based models. Happy to connect and share how.
```

### Manual Inspection Issues
```
Hi {{first_name}}, many {{process}} shops still rely on manual 
inspection. We help teams catch defects at line speed without 
inspector fatigue. Would love to connect.
```

### Scrap / Yield Problems
```
Hi {{first_name}}, noticed {{company}} is growing in {{industry}}. 
We help similar manufacturers cut scrap rates 30-40% with CAD-based 
inspection. Happy to connect.
```

### New Product Launch
```
Hi {{first_name}}, congrats on {{company}}'s new product launch. 
We help manufacturers build defect detection from CAD before first 
article — faster time to quality. Happy to connect.
