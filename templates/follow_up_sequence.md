# LinkedIn Follow-Up Message Sequence

## Day 0: Connection Accepted - Initial Message

```
Thanks for connecting, {{first_name}}!

I've been following {{company}}'s growth in {{industry}} - impressive
what you're building.

Quick question: are you currently exploring any automation or robotics
initiatives for {{specific_area}}?

We recently helped {{similar_company}} achieve {{specific_result}} and
I thought there might be some overlap with what you're working on.

Would love to hear what's top of mind for you.

Best,
Duncan

## Day 3: Value-Add Follow-Up

```
Hi {{first_name}},

Wanted to share something I thought you'd find useful.

We put together a quick guide on "{{relevant_topic}}" based on our
work with manufacturers in {{industry}}.

{{link_or_attachment}}

Let me know if any of it resonates with what you're seeing at {{company}}.

Best,
Duncan

## Day 7: Case Study / Social Proof

```
Hi {{first_name}},

Quick story I thought you'd appreciate:

{{similar_company}} was facing {{challenge}} - sound familiar?

We worked with them to implement {{solution}} and they saw:
• {{result_1}}
• {{result_2}}
• {{result_3}}

Happy to walk you through how they did it if you're curious.

## Day 14: Soft Ask

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this brief.

Would a 15-minute call make sense to explore whether our robotics
solutions could help {{company}} with {{specific_challenge}}?

If now's not the right time, no worries - happy to stay connected
and share relevant insights as they come up.

Here's my calendar if easier: {{calendly_link}}

Best,
Duncan

## Day 21: Final Follow-Up / Nurture

**If no response:**
```
Hi {{first_name}},

I'll keep this short - I know timing is everything.

If automation isn't a priority right now for {{company}}, totally
understand. I'll plan to check back in a few months.

In the meantime, feel free to reach out if anything changes or if
I can ever be a resource.

Best,
Duncan
