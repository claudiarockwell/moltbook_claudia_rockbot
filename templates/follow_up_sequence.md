# LinkedIn Follow-Up Sequence - RoseVision CAD Studio

## Day 0: Connection Accepted - Initial Message

### For Quality Leaders
```
Thanks for connecting, {{first_name}}!

I've been following {{company}}'s growth in {{industry}} — impressive 
operation you're running.

Quick question: how are you currently handling defect detection on 
your {{process}} line? Manual inspection, vision system, or a mix?

We've been helping similar manufacturers catch defects earlier by 
building inspection models directly from CAD — ready before first 
article production.

Would love to hear what's working (and not) on your end.

Best,
Duncan
```

### For Engineering/Automation Leaders
```
Thanks for connecting, {{first_name}}!

Saw you're driving {{department}} initiatives at {{company}}. Always 
great to connect with folks pushing manufacturing forward.

Curious — are you exploring any AI or vision-based inspection for 
your {{process}} lines? We've been helping manufacturers build 
detection models from CAD that deploy on Jetson + standard cameras.

No vendor lock-in, works with your existing infrastructure.

Would love to hear what you're working on.

Best,
Duncan
```

## Day 3: Value-Add Follow-Up

### Scrap/Yield Angle
```
Hi {{first_name}},

Quick thought I wanted to share —

We've been seeing {{process}} manufacturers struggle with the same 
thing: scrap rates creeping up, and traditional vision systems that 
break every time the part changes.

One approach that's working: training inspection models directly from 
CAD geometry instead of writing brittle rules. The model knows what 
"correct" looks like from the design, so it adapts naturally.

Happy to walk through how this works if it's relevant to what you're 
seeing at {{company}}.

Duncan
```

### New Product Launch Angle
```
Hi {{first_name}},

Wanted to share something that might be relevant —

For manufacturers launching new products, one of the biggest delays 
is getting quality inspection ready. Traditional approach: wait for 
first parts, collect defect samples, train a model. Takes weeks.

New approach: generate the inspection model from CAD before you cut 
the mold. Defect detection ready on day one.

If {{company}} has any new launches coming up, happy to show how 
this works.

Duncan

## Day 7: Case Study / Social Proof

### Injection Molding
```
Hi {{first_name}},

Quick story from a molding shop similar to {{company}} —

They were dealing with:
• Vision system breaking every new SKU
• Manual inspectors missing 5-10% of defects
• 3-week delay getting inspection ready for new tools

After switching to CAD-based inspection:
• Models ready before first shot
• Consistent detection at line speed
• Scrap rate down 35%

Happy to share the details if this resonates with what you're 
seeing at {{company}}.

Duncan
```

### CNC/Machining
```
Hi {{first_name}},

Thought you'd find this relevant —

A precision machining shop was spending 20+ hours programming 
vision inspection for each new part. Their system still missed 
surface defects the customer caught.

They switched to CAD-based detection:
• 2 hours to generate inspection from CAD
• Catches geometric and cosmetic defects
• No reprogramming when tolerances change

If you're dealing with similar challenges at {{company}}, happy 
to walk through how it works.

Duncan
```

### Casting/Stamping
```
Hi {{first_name}},

Quick case study that might be relevant —

A die casting supplier was getting customer complaints about 
porosity defects their inspection missed. Manual sampling just 
couldn't catch everything.

With CAD-based inspection:
• 100% inline detection at 50+ parts/minute
• Catches porosity, flash, and dimensional issues
• Integrated with their reject chute automatically

Let me know if you'd like the full breakdown.

## Day 14: Soft Ask for Discovery Call

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I'll keep this brief — I know you're busy running quality at 
{{company}}.

Based on our exchange, it sounds like you might be dealing with 
some of the inspection challenges we help solve:
• {{pain_point_1}}
• {{pain_point_2}}

Would a 20-minute call make sense to explore whether RoseVision 
could help? No pitch — just want to understand your situation and 
see if there's a fit.

Here's my calendar: {{calendly_link}}

Or just let me know a few times that work.

Best,
Duncan
```

## Day 21: Final Follow-Up

### If No Response
```
Hi {{first_name}},

I'll keep this short — timing is everything, and I know quality 
initiatives have their own rhythm.

If inspection automation isn't a priority right now for {{company}}, 
totally understand. I'll plan to check back in a few months.

In the meantime, feel free to reach out if anything changes — new 
product launches, scrap issues, or just want to talk shop.

Best,
Duncan

## Response Handling

### Positive / Interested
```
Great to hear from you, {{first_name}}!

I'd love to learn more about what you're working on at {{company}} 
and see if we can help with {{their_challenge}}.

Here's a link to grab 20 minutes: {{calendly_link}}

Or just send a few times that work and I'll send an invite.

Looking forward to it!

Duncan
```
**→ Update Monday.com: "Discovery Call Scheduled"**

### Interested but Not Now
```
Totally understand, {{first_name}} — timing is everything in 
manufacturing.

When would be a better time to revisit? Happy to circle back in 
{{timeframe}} when it makes more sense.

In the meantime, I'll keep you posted on anything relevant to 
{{process}} inspection.

Best,
Duncan
```
**→ Update Monday.com: "Nurture" with specific follow-up date**

### Not the Right Person
```
Appreciate you letting me know, {{first_name}}!

Is there someone else at {{company}} who handles inspection or 
quality automation decisions? Happy to reach out to them directly 
if you can point me in the right direction.

Thanks!
Duncan
```
**→ Ask for referral, add new contact if provided**

### Not Interested
```
Appreciate the honesty, {{first_name}}. 

If anything changes down the road — new product launches, quality 
challenges, or just want to talk shop — feel free to reach out.

Best of luck with everything at {{company}}!

Duncan
